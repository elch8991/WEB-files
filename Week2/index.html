    <h1><strong>The History of Pizza</strong></h1>
    <p>When people think of pizza they typically think of Italy, but flatbreads</p>
    <p> were consumed starting in ancient times by Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians.</p>

    <p>The pizza we recognize in modern times orginated in the city of Naples.</p>
    <p><strong>Naples</strong> was a waterfront city with a large population of impoverished citizens.</p>
    <p>They needed inexpensive food that could be eaten quickly on the street.</p>
    <p>While most people rejected the consumption of the flatbreads, in 1889 <em>King Umberto I</em> and <em>Queen Margherita</em></p>
    <p>visited Naples and on their visit dined on what is the modern day margarita pizza.</p>

    <p>their approval of the dish led to the spread of pizza popularity and the spark</p>
    <p>that has led to the modern staple of pizza that we know today.</p>
